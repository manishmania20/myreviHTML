    <p>This document is both a tutorial and a reference on shell scripting with Bash.
         It assumes no previous knowledge of scripting or programming, but progresses
         rapidly toward an intermediate/advanced level of instruction . . . all the
         while sneaking in little nuggets of UNIXÂ® wisdom and lore. It serves as a textbook,
         a manual for self-study, and as a reference and source of knowledge on shell scripting
         techniques. The exercises and heavily-commented examples invite active reader participation,
         under the premise that the only way to really learn scripting is to write scripts.</p>
